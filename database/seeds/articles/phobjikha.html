    <p>In the land-locked Bhutan, known to be the last Shangri-La in the world, lies Phobjikha Valley. Phobjikha Valley, a 4-hour
        drive away from Punakha, is an expansive glacial valley. After several days of visiting countless untouched monasteries
        at Thimphu and Punakha, I didn’t know what to expect from an unassuming place in the middle of the Black Mountain region.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Though a detour for most Bhutan tours, Phobjikha Valley is worth the long journey off the main highway. Upon arrival at Phobjikha
        Valley my family and I had a full-course meal at a local homestay. We conversed with the Bhutanese hosts and ate on pillows
        on the straw floor. Visiting homestay accommodations truly made it an immersive experience. Our lunch was a typical Bhutanese
        meal complete with butter tea, red rice, chili with cheese, and dried beef. Unlike any other cuisines I had tried, Bhutanese
        food is unique; it draws influences from its neighboring countries - India, China, and Nepal. In Bhutan, the last Buddhist
        kingdom in the world, people heavily rely on dairy products (such as butter, milk, and cheese) because they don’t kill
        animals. Interestingly enough, Bhutan imports all its meat from India. Initially, it was strange to find butter in my
        tea and cheese in my vegetables. Nonetheless, as a self-proclaimed foodie, I enjoyed the gastronomic experience.</p>

    <p>After our meal, we began the Gangtey Nature Trail, a relatively easy hike compared to the famous Paro Taktsang (also known
        as Tiger’s Nest Monastery) hike. Although nothing can truly beat the majesty of the Tiger’s Nest Monastery (since after
        all, it’s a monastery literally hanging off a cliff), the Gangtey Nature Trail is a completely different kind of beautiful.
        We started at a small hilltop overlooking Gangtey Goemba and then proceeded to head downhill through flower meadows.
        Going downhill was tricky since the rain made the trail quite muddy. In retrospect it’s not best to travel to Bhutan
        during the rainy season as it makes hiking and even driving on the highway dangerous. Despite the slippery slopes the
        flower meadows were tranquil. We even walked through a quaint village called the Semchubara village. It was picturesque;
        many Bhutanese farmers were harvesting rice in the fields. From there, we went through a dense forest, where the fresh
        air smelled like pine. It was the most serene part of the hike.</p>

    <p>From the forest we walked into the open valley. The valley is made of marshy land and grassy pastures where farm animals
        graze. The Phobjikha Valley was akin to the green, vast meadows from the “The Hills Are Alive” scene in the “Sound of
        Music”. This valley is most known for the globally threatened black-necked cranes from Tibet that visit the valley during
        the winter season. Although I didn’t get the opportunity to see these cranes myself, the vast meadows were truly breathtaking.</p>

    <p>Before travelling to Bhutan - a country my parents didn’t know existed, I had no idea what untouched beauty was in store.</p>
