                        <div class="article-text">
                            <p>Located in the foothills of the Andes and overlooking Nahuel Huapei Lake, San Carlos de Bariloche
                                is a quiet resort city, modeled after Alpine ski resorts. We arrived in late July, one of
                                the coldest months in Argentina, and one of the most popular times for skiing trips to Bariloche.</p>

                            <p>The entire highway, which snakes along the Nahuel Huapei Lake, is lined with resorts semi-hidden
                                by the towering pine trees. We stayed at one of these resorts: it was a group of bungalows
                                completely owned and operated by an elderly native couple. Our bungalow was tastefully decorated
                                and warm, and it provided welcome comfort, as we had just flown from the warm and humid Iguazu
                                Falls. The best part of our bungalow, however, were the sweeping panoramic windows facing
                                the lake. We would wake up as the sun slowly made its way out behind some trees in the lake’s
                                far corner. As it brightened up the surroundings, we were finally able to grasp the beauty
                                of this place. The tall spiky mountains, donning a snowy cap, rose up and around the glistening
                                water.</p>

                            <p>Later in the day, my brother convinced us that we should go out to see the lake instead of enjoying
                                the view from the comfort of our living room couch. We reluctantly agreed and hopped on a
                                short tour around the lake. Can confirm: it was worth it. We took a brief ski lift to the
                                top of a mountain, and despite the freezing wind, we stood outside to take in the view, and
                                yes, also to take plenty of photos. The Nahuel Huapei Lake surrounded us on three fronts
                                and mountains and islands popped up in the middle of it. The name Nahuel Huapei Lagos (“lake”
                                in Spanish) came from the native Mapuche language, with “Nahuel” meaning “jaguar” and “Huapei”
                                meaning “island”. There is a centuries-old legend about a giant creature living underneath
                                the waters. The creature is known as Nahuelito and has been the subject of many stories,
                                including Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel, The Lost World. While I don’t know about the existence
                                of Nahuelito, I do know that I wouldn’t want to leave either if I were living in (or on)
                                this lake.</p>

                            <p>Bariloche is also known for its chocolate. In fact, it’s been dubbed the “Chocolate Capital of
                                Argentina”. The colorfully decorated chocolate shops were ubiquitous in the city, and boutique
                                chocolate shops were the only three shops in the airport. They seemed to have chocolate in
                                any shade and shape. I would highly recommend buying one of the gift packs with an assortment
                                of chocolate. There were chocolates pulled into strings, chocolates filled with liquid chocolate,
                                chocolates fused with other kinds of snacks: basically any chocolate that you could imagine.</p>

                            <p>It is difficult to relive and describe what it was like to see the expansive lake and great mountains.
                                They make you feel infinitesimal and strong at the same time. It is an exceptional piece
                                of nature so don’t miss it if you ever travel to South America.</p>
